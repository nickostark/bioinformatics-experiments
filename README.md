# Bioinformatics experiment notes (practical documentation)

This repo contains simplified, experience-based documentation for computational experiments and pipelines I run during my PhD.

These are not official docs.
They focus on:
- minimal steps to get things running
- common errors and fixes
- HPC-specific constraints
- things I wish I had known earlier

Contributions are welcome.
